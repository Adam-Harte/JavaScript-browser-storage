		<h1>JavaScript Browser Storage</h1>
		<h3>Browser Storage and Storage Options</h3>
		<p>
			Browser storage allows us to store temporary data on a users machine in
			the browser. Common exmaples of browser storage would be storing temporary
			conveniecne data for a user such as preferred settings, current shopping
			cart etc. Another exmaple wouild be for authentication storing a JWT. We
			have four options for browser storage and they are localStorage,
			sessionStorage, cookies and indexedDB.
		</p>
		<h3>localStorage and sessionStorage</h3>
		<p>
			localStorage and sessionStorage work with simple key value pairs and can
			be useful to manage user preferences and basic user data. The localStorage
			and sessionStorage can be cleared by the user and via JavaScript. Not
			ideal for complex data. localStorage and sessionStorage cannot be read by
			the backend/server as they cannot be attached to a request in the headers.
			To use localStorage we use the 'keyword' localStorage which is part of the
			window object and gives us access to all the properties and methods of
			localStorage. We have methods to set and remove items, to clear
			localStorage and also to access data in localStorage. localStorage takes
			all data you store in it as a string and therfore if you pass something
			that isnt a string it will call the toString method on it. Therefore in
			the case of storing object data in localStorage it is best to JSON
			stringify it as toString will not work correctly. You have the same
			properties and methods available in sessionStorage so accessing, setting
			and removing the data is the same in both localStorage and sessionStorage.
			The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is localStorage
			persists on the users machine until it is either manually removed by the
			user or via JS whereas sessionStorage persists so long as the page on the
			active tab that created the storage data remains active, if the user
			closes that tab and opens a new tab but with the same web page you will
			see the localStorage still exists but the sessionStorage does not.
		</p>
		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>
			Cookies also allow us to store simple key value pairs however they can
			also be sent to the server/backend via request headers and can also
			contain special cofigiruations such as flags for HTTP only meaning only
			the backend/server has access to it or expiration times etc. These
			configuration flags are added by defining them after a semi colon
			seperarting the key value pair e.g. userId=123; max-age=60. Bear in mind
			any configuration flags we set are not included when we parse cookie data
			so it will not interfere with grabbing the data with a String.split for
			example. We access cookie data via 'document.cookie' and add data to
			cookies by assigning a new value with 'document.cookie = '. This may look
			strange as normally defining data with '=' would normally overrite
			existing data however with document.cookie this is not the case and
			instead just adds new data to the cookie we add the data as a string with
			the key name followed by an '=' and then the value. Cookies are also only
			available on a fully served page running on a server be it development or
			producton. Therefore running a static html page in the browser will not
			work when it comes to seeing and interacting with cookie data. There are
			no methods to get, set and remove cookie data instead cookie data is all
			held togeteher in a string with the key value pairs semi colon seperated
			so one technique would be to use the string split method to split the
			string at each semicolon to get the key value pairs in array format.
		</p>
		<h3>indexedDB</h3>
		<p>
			indexedDB is more complex acting as an in browser database for storing
			data. We can store more complex data with objects in an organised way
			similar to traditional database tables called objectStore. To use
			indexedDb we first have to open a connection to the in browser database
			which we do with the indexedDB open method. Once that connection has been
			established we can set the onupgradeneeded property to a function which
			allows us to create data upon the database creation/connection. Inside
			this onupgradeneeded function we grab our created/connected database with
			event.target.result. Then we can create a table like data storage called
			objectStore with the createObjectStore method. This method takes an
			argument for the name of the new objectStore as well as a configuration
			object for the keyPath. We can then add data to this objectStore on the
			transaction obejcts oncomplete method where we grab the created
			objectStore via the database transaction and then call the add method. The
			add method takes an object as an argument for all the data you want to add
			and this object must at least contain the keyPath you defined in the
			objectStore as part of the data being added.
