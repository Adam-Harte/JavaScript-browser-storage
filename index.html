		<h1>JavaScript Browser Storage</h1>
		<h3>Browser Storage and Storage Options</h3>
		<p>
			Browser storage allows us to store temporary data on a users machine in
			the browser. Common exmaples of browser storage would be storing temporary
			conveniecne data for a user such as preferred settings, current shopping
			cart etc. Another exmaple wouild be for authentication storing a JWT. We
			have four options for browser storage and they are localStorage,
			sessionStorage, cookies and indexedDB.
		</p>
		<h3>localStorage and sessionStorage</h3>
		<p>
			localStorage and sessionStorage work with simple key value pairs and can
			be useful to manage user preferences and basic user data. The localStorage
			and sessionStorage can be cleared by the user and via JavaScript. Not
			ideal for complex data. localStorage and sessionStorage cannot be read by
			the backend/server as they cannot be attached to a request in the headers.
			To use localStorage we use the 'keyword' localStorage which is part of the
			window object and gives us access to all the properties and methods of
			localStorage. We have methods to set and remove items, to clear
			localStorage and also to access data in localStorage. localStorage takes
			all data you store in it as a string and therfore if you pass something
			that isnt a string it will call the toString method on it. Therefore in
			the case of storing object data in localStorage it is best to JSON
			stringify it as toString will not work correctly. You have the same
			properties and methods available in sessionStorage so accessing, setting
			and removing the data is the same in both localStorage and sessionStorage.
			The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is localStorage
			persists on the users machine until it is either manually removed by the
			user or via JS whereas sessionStorage persists so long as the page on the
			active tab that created the storage data remains active, if the user
			closes that tab and opens a new tab but with the same web page you will
			see the localStorage still exists but the sessionStorage doesa not.
